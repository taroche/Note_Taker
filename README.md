  ## Description 
  
  *The what, why, and how:* 
  
  This is a web app made to make it easy to keep notes about anything you need to a note for. Like doctors appointments or needing to go to the bank or grocery list. You can save as many notes as you'd like. You are also able to delete notes after they are no longer needed. The front end came from UNH bootcamp and I made the server.
